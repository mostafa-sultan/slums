What is React Native, and how does it differ from React?

###### React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using React and JavaScript. While React is focused on building web user interfaces, React Native allows the creation of mobile apps using the same principles but with components specifically designed for mobile platforms.

Explain the concept of JSX in React Native. How is it used?

###### JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React Native. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX is then transformed into regular JavaScript code during the build process.

What are the key benefits of using React Native for mobile app development?
 
1. Cross-platform development.
2. Reusable components.
3. Fast development and hot-reloading.
4. Access to native modules and libraries.
5. Strong community support.

Describe the basic architecture of a React Native application.

###### React Native applications consist of JavaScript code running in a JavaScript engine on the device. This JavaScript code interacts with native modules responsible for rendering UI components and handling native device features.

How does React Native achieve cross-platform development?

###### React Native allows developers to write most of the code in JavaScript and React, which is then translated into native code for both iOS and Android platforms. This enables code reusability and faster development across different platforms.

Explain the role of the Virtual DOM in React Native.

###### The Virtual DOM is a representation of the app's UI in memory. React Native uses a simplified Virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual native UI components, minimizing the direct interaction with the native platform.

What is the significance of the "state" in React Native components?

###### The state represents the data that a component maintains and can change over time. When the state of a component changes, React Native re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.

Differentiate between state and props in React Native. 
1. State: Represents internal component data that can change. Managed using setState().
2. Props: External inputs passed to a component. Immutable and set by a parent component.

What are functional components, and when would you use them in React Native?

###### Functional components are stateless, functional React components that can receive props but don't have their own internal state. They are used when a component doesn't need to manage state or lifecycle methods.

How do you handle user input and form submission in React Native?

###### Use controlled components by binding the input value to the component's state. Handle form submissions by creating functions that update the state when inputs change and submit the form based on the state.

What are React Native Hooks? Provide examples of commonly used hooks.

###### Hooks are functions that allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features. Examples include useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.

Explain the purpose of AsyncStorage in React Native.

###### AsyncStorage is an API for persisting data on a mobile device. It allows storing and retrieving key-value pairs asynchronously, serving as a simple local storage solution for React Native apps.

What are the key differences between React Navigation and React Native Navigation? 

1. React Navigation: Pure JavaScript-based navigation solution. Easy to set up but may have performance limitations.
2. React Native Navigation: Native navigation solution. Offers better performance but requires additional setup.

How do you optimize performance in a React Native application?
 
1. Use PureComponent and shouldComponentUpdate for efficient rendering.
2. Employ FlatList or SectionList for optimized list rendering.
3. Minimize unnecessary re-renders and avoid unnecessary state updates.

What is the significance of the Flexbox layout in React Native?

###### Flexbox is a layout model that allows designing complex layouts with a more efficient and predictable structure. React Native uses Flexbox for component layout, providing a responsive design system.

How can you integrate third-party libraries in a React Native project?

###### Use NPM or Yarn to install third-party libraries. Link native modules using react-native link or manually link them when necessary. Follow library-specific documentation for further integration steps.

Explain the concept of native modules in React Native.

###### Native modules are JavaScript APIs that expose native code to the React Native JavaScript runtime. They allow communication between JavaScript and native code, enabling access to native features not available in JavaScript.

What is the significance of Redux in React Native, and how does it work?

###### Redux is a state management library that helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way. It provides a centralized store that holds the entire state of the app and enables components to access the state or dispatch actions to modify it.

How do you handle navigation between screens in a React Native app?

###### Use navigation libraries like React Navigation or React Native Navigation. Define navigation stacks, navigate between screens using navigation actions, and pass parameters as needed.

Describe the process of building and deploying a React Native app to Android and iOS devices.
  
1. For Android: Use Android Studio to build the APK or bundle and deploy it using the react-native run-android command.
2. For iOS: Use Xcode to build the app and deploy it using the react-native run-ios command.
